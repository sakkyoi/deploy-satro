# Description

Satro is a ready-to-use static site generator that is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). This repository is a template that you can use to deploy your site of [satro](https://github.com/sakkyoi/satro) to various platforms.

# Prerequisites

- [Deploy to Cloudflare Pages](/article/deploy-cloudflare)
- [Deploy to GitHub Pages](/article/deploy-github)

## Workflow not being run on forked repository

You may have noticed that the workflow isn't being run on your forked repository. This is because of security reasons. You can enable the workflow by just clicking on the `I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them` button as shown below.

## Workflow dispatch

The workflow files provided in this repository are not triggered by push in default. You can trigger the workflow by using the `workflow_dispatch` event. You can find the `workflow_dispatch` event in the Actions tab of your repository.

Or you can remove the comment from the workflow file to trigger the workflow on push.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/*.yaml" del={3-4} ins={5-6}
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
- # push:
- #   branches: [ "main" ]
+ push:
+   branches: [ "main" ]
```

# Configure site

Assuming you have already setting up the deploy workflow (including those environment variables starting with `SITE_`) mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
